This was a challenge!
It's definitely a struggle to conceptualize the outputs and return values of all the various mathods and keep it sensical. 
There were multiple points where additional spec requirements (Like the computer guessing algorithm) forced me to reconsider my approach and refactor things.
It's undoubtedly fragile and barely functional, this will be interesting to come back to when I've more confidence and can see my flawed approach more distinctly.
Still, learned a lot about classes, and researching algorithms and methodologies I know nothing about.
